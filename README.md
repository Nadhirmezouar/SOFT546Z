# SOFT546Z coursework:
#### The aim of this project, is to design and interactive distributed system. Buggy Robot monitoring the environment is a distributed system which interacts with the operator using IR Remote controller, LCD screen and Webpage diplaying sensors measurments in realtime.
## Repository Overview:
> SOFT564Z: Github Repository
<br>
<br>
>> Arduino-main: Arduino source code, used to control buggy movement and sensor readings, as well as the serial communication with ESP32.
<br>
<br>
>>> define.h: defining all sensors and libraries variables.
<br>
<br>
>> ESP32-main: ESP32 source code, used to receive sensors data from arduino and display it on local webpage using ESP32 server.
<br>
<br>
>> IR_REMOTE_DECODE: IR Remote source code,used to read HEX values of pressed buttons so we can program the robot actions.
<br>
<br>

## Instructions:
To start using the robot: 
<br>
<br>
1-Download the repository to your PC.
<br>
<br>
2-Open SOFT564Z and upload Arduino-main to arduino Uno.
<br>
<br>
3-Open SOFT564Z and upload ESP32-main to ESP32 Board and setup WIFI name and password in the source code.
<br>
<br>
4-Use IR_REMOTE_DECODE source file to update your IR Remote control buttons HEX Values in Arduino-main.
<br>
<br>
5-Follow the GPIO connection privded in circuit.png and switch on powersupply.
<br>
<br>
6-While Connecting ESP32 With Serial Monitor, Local IP Address will be provided after WIFI is connected.
<br>
<br>
7-Open browser with the given local IP Address and the check sensors readings from both LCD and webpage in realtime.
<br>
<br>
8- Use arrows to move the robot and enjoy playing with it.
